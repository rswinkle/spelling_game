Spelling Game
=============

The game is an endless loop that does the following

Given a 2-4 letter prefix that has words in the provided wordlist, try to finish those words.
Words you get are displayed above the prompt.
3 bad guesses and some words you could have used are given and a letter is knocked off.
If there is only one letter left go to the top of the loop (pick a new prefix, clear the correct
guesses list)

I will expand/rewrite this when I'm not so tired
